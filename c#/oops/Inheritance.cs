/// Inheritance (Derived and Base Class)
/// 
/// In C#, it is possible to inherit fields and methods from one class to another. 
/// We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
/// - Derived Class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
/// - Base Class (parent) - the class being inherited from
/// 
/// To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.
/// 
/// In the example below, the Car class (child) inherits the fields and methods from the Vehicle class (parent):

namespace Test.Inheritance;

class Vehicle
{
    public string brand = "Ford";   // Vehicle field
    public void honk()              // Vehicle method 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Tuut, tuut!");
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle  // derived class (child)
{
    public string modelName = "Mustang";  // Car field
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a myCar object
        Car myCar = new Car();

        // Call the honk() method (From the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
        myCar.honk();

        // Display the value of the brand field (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class
        Console.WriteLine(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);
    }
}

///
/// Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?
/// 
/// - It is useful for code reusability: reuse fields and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
/// Tip: Also take a look at the next chapter, Polymorphism, which uses inherited methods to perform different tasks.
